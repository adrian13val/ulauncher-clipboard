# ulauncher-clipboard

[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io) extension for managing your clipboard, using Gpaste

![](screenshot.png)

## Usage

Install [GPaste](https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste/) if you haven't.

Open Ulauncher and type the keyword `c` followed by a space. This will search your clipboard history. Activate an entry (for example by pressing enter or clicking on it). This will copy it your actual clipboard. Now you can paste it elsewhere.

From Ulauncher's preferences you can change the keyword, number of results that are shown (6 by default) and the amount of "context" which is shown for longer texts which can't fit on one line.

## Caveats

I've created github issues for the known limitations and quirks. Let me know if you have input.
